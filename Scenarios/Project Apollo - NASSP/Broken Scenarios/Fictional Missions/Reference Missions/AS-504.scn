AS-504 (February 01, 1968). Alfred Davidson (CDR), Turnage Lindsey (CMP), Lloyd Reeder (LMP). CSM: Apollo 504. In the lead up to the first Apollo lunar flights NASA created a series of simulated missions for testing, training and study purposes. This mission is a simple free-return trajectory with a flyby of the lunar surface. Unlike the historic Apollo 8 mission there is no requirement to break into or out of lunar orbit. 

After launch there are two opportunities for TLI.

1. TLI occurs at GET 02:39:54. Perycynthion occurs at approximately GET 77:30:46.

2. TLI occurs at GET 04:08:26. Perycynthion occurs at approximately GET 79:06:36

Launch Date & TLI details come from "Saturn V, AS-504 Launch Vehicle Reference Trajectory", May 1967. (AS-504)
