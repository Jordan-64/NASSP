BEGIN_DESC
AS-203 was an unmanned launch test of the Saturn 1b, its primary goal was to test the effects of weightlessness on liquid hydrogen and whether or not it was feasable to restart the J-2 engine in orbit after orbital instertion. The S-IVb stage was fitted with two cameras which pointed into the liquid hydrogen fuel tank and allowed the contents to be monitored during the flight. The mission lasted for five Earth orbits and terminated when the S-IVb stage exploded during a pressurization test.
