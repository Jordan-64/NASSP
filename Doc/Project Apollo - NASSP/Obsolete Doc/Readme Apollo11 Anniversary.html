<p><font size="3"><b><font face="Arial">INTRODUCTION</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>The fifth manned Apollo mission (and the one NASA declared 
  was to make the first lunar landing) was launched on July 16, 1969. Four days 
  later, on July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module 
  Pilot Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin landed within a pre-designated elliptical 
  landing area, on the Sea of Tranquility. This was the very first time that human 
  beings landed on the surface of a heavenly body other than that of our Planet 
  Earth. During the final approach, Armstrong recognized West Crater right at 
  pitchover and in fact, prolonged the landing a bit so that he could avoid landing 
  in it. He touched down in a very flat and level area and only after a few hours 
  of preparation and going over the EVA checklists, Neil Armstrong went out of 
  the LM hatch, descended the ladder, and became the first human being to ever 
  walk on the moon.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Aldrin followed him down the ladder a few minutes later, 
  and for the next two hours they explored what Buzz referred to as the &quot;magnificent 
  desolation&quot; of the lunar surface immediately around the LM. The EVA being 
  broadcasted live around the globe, the whole world watched in awe and wonder 
  as the two astronauts explored and set up experiments. People who remember that 
  historical broadcast still recall vividly the inspiring and proud feeling that 
  human beings have now truly touched another world and that the first tiny steps 
  in humanity's feeble attempts to conquer the stars has begun.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b><font face="Arial">THE ADD-ON</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">This add-on simply changes the default NASSP v4.xx LM meshes, 
  the astronaut (lunar EVA) mesh, and the US Flag mesh with some detailed and 
  Apollo 11 specific meshes. I wanted to come up with this add-on because today, 
  July 16, 2003, marks the 34th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch, and I wanted 
  those Orbiter and NASSP fans who are currently simulating the AP11 flight and 
  lunar landing to have a more or less accurate 3D-representation of the AP11 
  LM and astronaul Neil Armstrong, when he took is first step on the lunar surface. 
  Take note that this add-on:</font></p>
<p><font size="3">1. DOES NOT provide any new scenery mesh. You have to download 
  and configure Jtiberius' Tranquility Base scenery files for Orbiter in order 
  to have an AP11 landing site.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">2. DOES NOT alter any of the NASSP modules.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">3. DOES NOT come with other fancy LEVA enhancements. It's just 
  simply Neil and the US Flag (if I have more time I might add Buzz, the T.V. 
  Cam and antenna, and the SWC experiment later).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Simply unzip the package into your ORBITER folder. If prompted 
  with &quot;Overwrite?&quot; respond with a YES.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">IMPORTANT NOTES:</font></p>
<p><font size="3">1. The new LM has landing probes sticking out from underneath 
  the footpads. Now, I've noticed that when landing at Jtiberius' Tranquility 
  mesh, the LM seems to be NOT touching the surface mesh, making it appear to 
  float in the air a bit. The astronaut does this float thing too. I will ask 
  permission from Kopp if I could nudge his mesh a bit upwards so it comes into 
  contact with the LM footpads and release it as a fix later.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">2. Due to what I believe is the high polycount of the new LM, 
  there seems to be a delay/freeze when you press the button to extract the LM 
  from the SIVB. Don't worry, the extraction will still take place in a few seconds 
  and you may still be able to catch a glimpse of the SIVB drifting away when 
  you press F1 (external view).</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b><font face="Arial">LANDING DAY</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Sorry, I was too busy to look for AP11 landing scenarios, but 
  I'm sure the &quot;Lunar Mafia&quot; gang (i.e. YesRushGen, Missleman01 and 
  JoeyBigO) can provide you with EVERYTHING to make a nice lunar landing scenario 
  for AP11. Just ask them nicely in the Orbiter forums hehehe.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="3"><b><font face="Arial">FUTURE PLANS</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"> Yes, sometime in the future, I shall make a TRANQILITY 2003 
  scenery mesh, and it will feature this more detailed Descent Stage sitting at 
  the historical AP11 landing site along with the other items left behind by Neil 
  and Buzz on the lunar surface. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b><font face="Arial">TOOLS USED</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Being a Media Production Specialist for a major Philippine university 
  has its advantages--I have access to some nice software being used for educational
